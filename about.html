    <h6 class="about-subheadings">My Background</h6>
    <p class="about-section">
      I was born. You‚Äôre welcome. My story begins with a situation of
      miscommunication. My former humans had the audacity to bring home a puppy.
      Said humans clearly didn‚Äôt understand, I hate dogs. They soon came to
      understand my loathery for the canine species, which unfortunately, did
      not work in my favor. They described me as, ‚Äúnot getting along the dog‚Äù
      and then, they dumped me into an animal shelter. I was housed in a Petco
      in Baltimore, Maryland for 4 months. It was quite a bore. Soon I took up
      the self-appointed position of front door security guard. During my 4
      month tenture, I was a celebrity among the volunteers and staff. What can
      I say? I‚Äôm a fluffy feline god. My position was taken from me when my
      human adopted me. C'est la vie. It started off great. We dwelled in the
      city, I watched daily commuters from the window. I even saw a
      hit-and-round, very exciting....except the loud noise. Rude. I
      digress...The city life was perfect. Until we moved to the suburbs...that
      was when I first encountered the trash truck. It was a big, green,
      mean-looking machine. I dislike it to this day. The suburbs may have more
      animals to watch, but far less commuters and firetrucks to watch. *le
      sigh* That all being said, the human is tolerable and there is no dog in
      the picture which is the best part of our arrangement.

    <h6 class="about-subheadings">Daily Diary</h6>
    <p class="about-section">
      At the first sound of dawn, I alert the household of my empty bowl
      situation. It really is a terrible sight to see first thing in the
      morning. After what the human refer to as ‚Äúbitching‚Äù (I prefer describing
      it as requesting with authority), I eat my decadent chicken pat√©. I spend
      many mornings sleeping in my luxurious bed seated upon a cedar chest. It
      is one of my favorite pastimes. My other petit joie de vivre is
      overlooking my kingdom from the second floor window. As you can imagine, I
      keep a close eye on any dogs passing by my territory. It is preeminent
      task to watch them like a hawk. In times of feeling mischevious, I like to
      sneak into the forbidden basement to poledance on a carpeted pipe. I may
      or may not have been repeatedly told the pipe was not my scratch post. But
      I do what I want, despite my human‚Äôs wishes. üòà <br /><br />
